## 🛠 Setup / Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

git clone https://github.com/FarhanRana234/ML_and_AI_Projects.git
cd ML_and_AI_Projects 

2. **(Optional) Create a virtual environment**

# Unix/macOS
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run Jupyter notebooks

Navigate to any project folder and open the notebooks to explore or run experiments.

🎯 Usage

Use the Jupyter notebooks to learn: follow annotated steps, experiment with parameters, visualize results.

Use modular code modules (model.py, train.py, utils.py) to build your own extensions.

Reuse datasets or preprocessing scripts for experimentation.

Use as a baseline for real-world applications: data ingestion → modeling → evaluation → deployment.

🧠 Featured Projects

AI Assistant using OpenAI API – Interactive assistant leveraging large language models.

AI Resume Critiquer – Automated system to analyze and critique resumes.

NLP Folder – Text classification, sentiment analysis, language modeling projects.

Scikit-Learn Folder – Classical ML algorithms: regression, classification, clustering, dimensionality reduction.

Deep Learning / Computer Vision – CNNs, transfer learning, object detection, etc.

✅ Why Use This Repository?

Ready-to-use: Code, notebooks, and dependencies are organized.

Learning-oriented: Great for students, hobbyists, or those wanting hands-on AI experience.

Modular & Extensible: Fork or adapt parts of the code for your own projects.

Variety: Covers multiple ML/AI domains — ideal for learning trade-offs between methods.

📌 How You Can Contribute

Add your own project folders with clear documentation.

Improve existing notebooks with comments, visualizations, or experiments.

Update requirements.txt as dependencies evolve.

Add a README.md in each project folder explaining the project.

Fix bugs, add tests, or provide performance benchmarks.

⚠️ Notes & Considerations

Some projects may require large datasets or GPU resources — check each notebook.

Ensure compatible library versions (see requirements.txt).

Verify dataset licenses before using in production.

This repository is for educational and experimentation purposes, not production-ready deployment.
