ML_and_AI_Projects

A collection of practical Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence projects

🔍 Overview

This repository is a curated collection of projects across supervised & unsupervised learning, deep learning, natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, and more. It is designed for learning, experimentation and building real‑world AI applications.

Each project includes:

Clean, modular code

Jupyter notebooks for exploration

A requirements.txt (or equivalent) listing dependencies

Self‑contained examples or datasets where applicable

🛠 Setup / Installation

Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/FarhanRana234/ML_and_AI_Projects.git
cd ML_and_AI_Projects


(Optional) Create a virtual environment

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # on Unix/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate      # on Windows


Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt


Navigate to a specific project folder and open the Jupyter notebook(s) to explore or run.

🎯 Usage

Use the Jupyter notebooks to learn: read the annotated steps, play with parameters, see results.

Use the modular code modules (e.g., model.py, train.py, utils.py) to build your own extensions.

Reuse datasets or preprocessors for experimentation and comparison.

Use as a baseline for real‑world applications: data ingestion → modelling → evaluation → deployment.

🧠 Featured Projects

AI Assistant using OpenAI API – building an interactive assistant leveraging large‑language models.

AI Resume Critiquer – automated system to analyze and critique resumes for improvements.

NLP Folder – many notebooks/projects on text classification, sentiment analysis, language modelling.

Scikit‑Learn Folder – classical ML algorithms: regression, classification, clustering, dimensionality reduction.

Deep Learning / Computer Vision – projects involving CNNs, transfer learning, object detection etc.

✅ Why Use This Repository?

Ready‑to‑use: Code, notebooks and dependencies are already organised.

Learning‑oriented: Great for students, hobbyists or someone wanting to get hands‑on quickly.

Modular & Extensible: You can fork or adapt parts of the code for your own projects.

Variety: Covers a broad spectrum of ML/AI domains — helpful for trying different methods and understanding tradeoffs.

📌 How You Can Contribute

Add your own project folders (following the structure) with clear documentation.

Improve existing notebooks: add more comments, visualisations, experiments.

Update requirements.txt as dependencies evolve.

Add README inside each project folder explaining that project in isolation.

Fix bugs, add tests, or provide performance benchmarks.

⚠️ Notes & Considerations

Some projects may require large datasets or GPU resources — check each notebook for details.

Ensure you have compatible library versions (check requirements.txt).

Be aware of licensing: some datasets may have restrictions — always verify before use in production.

This repository is for educational / experimentation purposes, not (yet) production‑grade deployment.
